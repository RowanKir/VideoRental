My problem domain is a information System for a video Rental Store.

Its a stand-alone store, not a large Enterprise
A video or movie can be any medium(eg. VCR, DVD)
The rental charge may vary by medium.
The store is a rental store, not sales.
All transactions are rentals.
Payments can be cash payments or credit on account can be used.
Manager oversees all the business during working hours and has the authority to modify any transaction
At the end of the day the admin checks all transactions
At the end of transaction, the customer receives a report with information on the transaction
